# Yet Another Lisp Environment

## Expression
Expressions are represented as structures which vary behaviour based upon their type.

1. Symbol expressions.
2. List expressions.
3. Lambda expressions.
4. Function expressions.

The behaviour of these structures should be fairly self-descriptive. However, a more comprehensive analysis follows.

## Environment
The environment is itself an expression.

## Evaluate
Evaluation is fairly simple.

## Reader
The reader is very simple.

## Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop
The project comes together in the REPL.
